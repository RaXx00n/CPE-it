CPEit - Common Platform Enumeration Inventory Tools - 2023 CSI Project


CPEit project consists of two components under development:

  *An Agent containing scripts that gather information on the software installed on a machine from multiple system sourcs,
  makes an educated guess on potential CPEs, and prepares them for ingestion into Elastic.
  
  *An ELK stack configured for taking the JSON data generated by the Agent and fuzzy string-matching NIST's Official CPE Dictionary for it,
  allowing an administrator to quickly build an inventory of CPEs for all installed software on their environment, and keep it up to date automatically
  by setting the Agent to run on intervals and Elastic to generate alerts.
